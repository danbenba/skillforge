# MCP Server Integration

SkillForge exposes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server so any MCP-capable coding agent can invoke all package management operations directly: installing skills mid-session, listing what's available, validating skill quality, and generating suggestions.

The server is **agent-agnostic**. It communicates over stdio and speaks plain MCP, so Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, and any other MCP client all work the same way. All tools except `skillforge_suggest` are pure package-management operations (filesystem + registry) and call no LLM; their behavior is identical regardless of which agent invokes them. Only `skillforge_suggest` reaches an LLM, and only it needs an API key.

---

## Setup

### 1. Install SkillForge

```bash
npm install -g skillforge
```

Or from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danbenba/skillforge.git
cd skillforge
npm install && npm run build
npm link
```

### 2. Register the server with your agent

The server is launched with `skillforge mcp` (a stdio server). Point your agent's MCP config at that command.

**Claude Code**: `.mcp.json` in the project root, or the global `~/.claude/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skillforge": {
      "command": "skillforge",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Codex**: `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.skillforge]
command = "skillforge"
args = ["mcp"]
```

The `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable is only needed if you use the `skillforge_suggest` tool. Add it via the config's `env` block:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skillforge": {
      "command": "skillforge",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```toml
# Codex equivalent
[mcp_servers.skillforge]
command = "skillforge"
args = ["mcp"]
env = { ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-..." }
```

To point `skillforge_suggest` at a custom Anthropic-compatible endpoint instead, set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, and optionally `SKILLPM_SUGGEST_MODEL` in the same `env` block. See [suggest.md](suggest.md#custom-endpoints).

### 3. Restart your agent

After saving the config, restart the agent (or reload its MCP servers). The SkillForge tools will appear in the tool list.

---

## Transport

The MCP server uses **`StdioServerTransport`**: it communicates over stdin/stdout, the standard for local MCP servers. There is no HTTP server, no port, and no authentication needed.

---

## Available Tools

### `skillforge_validate`

Validate a skill folder and return its format conformance score.

**Input:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

        "specVersion": "1.0",
        "score": 91,
        "path": "skills/forensics-agent"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Example prompt to Claude Code:**

### `skillforge_suggest`

Generate AI-powered skill suggestions based on project context.

**Input:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `projectPath` | `string` | No | Path to project. Defaults to the server's working directory. |

**Output:**

```json

      "available": true
    },
    {
      "skillName": "test-writer",
      "reason": "package.json has extensive test scripts",
      "suggestedScope": "project",
      "available": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**Requirements:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` must be set in the server's environment (see setup above). Alternatively, point it at a custom Anthropic-compatible endpoint with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` + `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`; see [suggest.md](suggest.md#custom-endpoints).

**Example prompt to Claude Code:**
> "Suggest skills I should install for this project based on the codebase."

---

### `skillforge_search`

Search the SkillForge registry for skills.

> **Status:** Stub; returns an empty result set. Full registry search is not yet implemented.

**Input:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `query` | `string` | Yes | Search query |

**Output:**

```json
{
  "results": [],
  "total": 0,
  "message": "Registry search is not yet available in this version."
}
```

---

## Available Resources

For MCP clients that support resource reading, the server exposes:

| URI | Content |
|---|---|
| `skillforge://docs/skills-sh-api` | **Mandatory reference** for the skills.sh API — bundled snapshot of [skills.sh/docs/api](https://www.skills.sh/docs/api) (Vercel OIDC authentication, endpoints, rate limits, response shapes). Read it before any request to skills.sh. Served with `priority: 1` annotations (effectively required). |
| `skill://index.json` | SEP-2640 discovery document: the most installed skills of the registry |
| `skill://<name>/SKILL.md` | The SKILL.md of a registry skill |
| `skill://<name>/<path>` | Any auxiliary file of a registry skill |

---

## Working Directory

The MCP server resolves the `project` scope relative to its working directory when it starts. When launched by Claude Code, this is typically the project root.

If you're using the server for a different project than where it started, pass an explicit `projectPath` to `skillforge_suggest`, or use absolute paths with `skillforge_install`.

---

## Example Claude Code Session

```
User: What skills do I have installed?

Claude: [calls skillforge_list]
You have 1 skill installed at project scope:
- forensics-agent (score: 91/100, community)

User: Install the test-writer skill from my ~/skills directory.

Claude: [calls skillforge_install with source=~/skills/test-writer, scope=project]
Installed "test-writer" at project scope. Score: 84/100.

User: Suggest some more skills for this project.

Claude: [calls skillforge_suggest]
Based on your project context, I'd suggest:
1. code-reviewer: your package.json shows a TypeScript project with a review workflow
2. docs-generator: your README mentions documentation as a goal

Would you like me to install either of these?
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Could not connect to MCP server"**
- Verify the path in `args` is absolute and correct
- Run `node /path/to/SkillForge/dist/mcp/server.js` directly and check for errors
- Make sure `npm run build` was run after any changes

**"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is required"**
- The `skillforge_suggest` tool requires the API key in the server's environment
- Add it to the `env` section of your `.mcp.json`

**Tools not appearing in Claude Code**
- Restart Claude Code after modifying `.mcp.json`
- Check that the JSON is valid (no trailing commas, etc.)
- Check Claude Code's MCP server logs

---

## Remote mode (claude.ai custom connector)

The same server also runs over Streamable HTTP for claude.ai:

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # set SKILLFORGE_ENV, SKILLFORGE_PORT, SKILLFORGE_PUBLIC_URL
skillforge serve       # or: docker compose up -d --build
```

Then on claude.ai: **Settings > Connectors > Add custom connector** with the URL
`https://<your-domain>/mcp` (no authentication, unless `SKILLFORGE_AUTH_TOKEN` is set).

Remote mode exposes the catalog tools only (`skillforge_start`, `skillforge_search`,
`skillforge_skillset_search`, `skillforge_inspect`, `skillforge_activate`,
`skillforge_file`, `skillforge_compare`, `skillforge_validate_remote`); the
filesystem install tools are stdio-only, because claude.ai has no access to your disk.
On claude.ai, installation is *virtual*: `skillforge_activate` returns the complete
SKILL.md and Claude follows it verbatim for the rest of the conversation. For a
permanent install, Claude recreates the skill in the claude.ai skill panel and you
click **"Copy to your skills"**.
